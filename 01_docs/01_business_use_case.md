# 📕 Project Atlas – Analytics ETL Foundations

## 📕 Background

**Project Atlas** is an analytics and data engineering project developed during the Webeet Internship Program as part of practical training in data analytics.

The project works with multiple publicly available NYC education datasets, including school safety reports, institutional reference data, demographic indicators, and academic outcomes.  
While these datasets provide substantial analytical potential, they are fragmented across sources, inconsistently structured, and vary significantly in data quality and reporting standards.

Without careful preparation, these characteristics make reliable analysis, comparison, and interpretation difficult.

## 📕 Business Focus

The primary focus of Project Atlas is not immediate decision-making or prediction, but the creation of a **robust, transparent, and reproducible analytical foundation**.

From a business and professional analytics perspective, the emphasis lies on:
- Understanding real-world data constraints  
- Applying disciplined data preparation practices  
- Documenting assumptions, limitations, and quality issues clearly  

This mirrors real analytics environments, where trust in the data is a prerequisite for any downstream insight generation.

## 📕 Strategic Initiative

Within the internship framework, Project Atlas follows a structured, task-based initiative designed to simulate professional analytics workflows.

The initiative focuses on:
- Exploring unfamiliar datasets under time constraints  
- Cleaning and validating data using Python and SQL  
- Integrating multiple data sources into a relational database  
- Producing clear, reviewable documentation alongside technical work  

Rather than optimizing for speed or completeness, the initiative prioritizes **analytical correctness, transparency, and reproducibility**.

## 📕 Data-Driven Approach

All steps in Project Atlas are grounded in evidence-based analysis and explicit validation.

The analytical goals include:
- Identifying structural and quality limitations within each dataset  
- Ensuring safe and well-documented joins across data domains  
- Preserving missingness and ambiguity instead of masking them  
- Creating analysis-ready tables suitable for descriptive exploration  

Exploratory analysis, transformation logic, and aggregation steps are deliberately separated to maintain clarity and auditability.

## 📌 Vision

Project Atlas aims to demonstrate how meaningful analytics work begins **before modeling or interpretation**, by establishing confidence in the underlying data.

By combining technical execution with disciplined documentation, the project highlights best practices in professional data analytics and lays the groundwork for future extensions, such as deeper analysis, visualization, or modeling.

📌 This project reflects the intersection of **learning-focused analytics practice and real-world data engineering standards**, using transparency and reproducibility as central guiding principles.
