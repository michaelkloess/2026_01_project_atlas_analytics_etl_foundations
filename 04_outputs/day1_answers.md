🔗 [Google Sheet:](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kz3ldkHb1kcsXktrBiS8cEL0Q3EFUnzSvjreYkUVgBY/edit?usp=sharing)

### Answers:
- Total rows: 6314 (6312 – without the last two empty columns)
- Unique schools: 1890
- Most frequent incident type: non-criminal crimes
- Bronx incident %: 28.24%
- Total Amount of Incidents: 28151

### Observations:
- Incidents are geographically concentrated in Brooklyn and the Bronx, which together account for well over half (58.37 %) of all reported incidents, while Staten Island and N/A contribute only marginal shares (7.34 %).
- When normalized by the number of schools per Borough, the Bronx shows the highest share of incidents (31 %), followed by Brooklyn (30.17 %) and Manhattan (22.21 %), while Staten Island accounts for only a very small proportion (2.69 %).
- More in-depth analysis is needed to identify the causes and reasons.
