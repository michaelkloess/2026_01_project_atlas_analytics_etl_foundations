# 📕 Project_Atlas_Analytics_ETL_Foundations

**📌 Project Overview**  
This project documents my work during the Webeet Internship Program, which I completed as part of my practical training as a Data Analyst. The project represents my end-to-end learning journey, covering a 5-day onboarding plan, exploratory data analysis, Python-based analytics, SQL querying via Python, and structured data integration into a AWS PostgreSQL database.

The goal of this project is to present the tasks I completed as a cohesive analytics project that reflects real-world data workflows and professional standards.

## 📕 Business Context

### 📌 Challenge
As a new intern, the main challenge was to quickly adapt to a professional data analytics environment. 
This included setting up the required tools, understanding unfamiliar datasets, and applying analytical methods under time constraints while following team standards for documentation and version control.

### 📌 Solution
The internship program was structured into daily tasks that gradually increased in complexity. 
Through guided sessions and independent work, I applied Python, SQL, and database concepts to real datasets. 
Each task required clear documentation, reproducible analysis, and submission via GitHub Commits and Pull Requests.

### 📌 Objectives
- Successfully complete all onboarding and analytical tasks  
- Apply Python and SQL to real-world datasets  
- Practice structured data exploration and cleaning  
- Work with a AWS PostgreSQL database via Python  
- Document results in a professional and reproducible way  

## 📕 Technology Stack

### 📌 Core Technologies
- **Database:** AWS PostgreSQL  
- **Programming:** SQL, Python  
- **Development:** Jupyter Notebook, VS Code  
- **Libraries:** Pandas, SQLAlchemy, Matplotlib  

### 📌 Implementation Approach
- **Data Processing:** SQL queries executed via Python followed by Pandas analysis  
- **Segmentation:** Exploratory and rule-based analytical logic depending on task scope  
- **Documentation:** Markdown files and Jupyter Notebooks tracked with Git
